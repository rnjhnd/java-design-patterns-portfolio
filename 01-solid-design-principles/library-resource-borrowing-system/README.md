# Library Resource Borrowing System

A Java implementation of a **SOLID Design Principles** compliant library resource borrowing system. This project demonstrates how to apply the **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** to create a flexible and extensible library management system that can seamlessly accommodate new resource types without violating other SOLID principles.

## üìã Overview

The Library Resource Borrowing System allows students to borrow various types of library resources including books, journals, audiobooks, and e-journals. The system is designed with SOLID principles in mind, particularly the **Dependency Inversion Principle**, which ensures that high-level modules (Student) depend on abstractions (Borrowable interface) rather than concrete implementations.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project implements **SOLID Design Principles** with the following components:

- **Borrowable Interface**: Defines the contract for all borrowable resources
- **Student Class**: High-level module that depends on the Borrowable abstraction
- **Concrete Resource Classes**: Book, Journal, AudioBook, and EJournal implementations
- **Test Program**: Demonstrates the SOLID principles in action

### SOLID Principles Implementation

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: The system is open for extension (new resource types) but closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: All resource types can be substituted for the Borrowable interface
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: The Borrowable interface is focused and cohesive
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Student depends on the Borrowable abstraction, not concrete implementations

### Design Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new resource types without modifying existing code
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns and loose coupling
- **Testability**: Easy to mock and test individual components
- **Extensibility**: New resource types can be added without breaking existing functionality
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing ensures compile-time safety

The following diagram illustrates:
- The architecture of the Library Resource Borrowing System
- Relationships between the core components:
  - The `Borrowable` interface as the abstraction
  - Concrete implementations: `Book`, `Journal`, `AudioBook`, `EJournal`
  - The `Student` class depending on the `Borrowable` abstraction
- How the Dependency Inversion Principle is applied in this project

## üöÄ Features

- **Multiple Resource Types**: Support for Books, Journals, AudioBooks, and E-Journals
- **SOLID Compliant**: Implements all five SOLID design principles
- **Type-Safe Operations**: Strong typing for all resource types
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new resource types
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-structured, maintainable code
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code, etc.)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone or download** the project files
2. **Navigate** to the project directory
3. **Compile** the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac src/*.java
   ```
4. **Run** the application:
   ```bash
   java -cp src TestProgram
   ```

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage

The main application (`TestProgram.java`) demonstrates how to use the SOLID-compliant borrowing system:

```java
// Create students
Student student1 = new Student("Dominic Santos", "22-16901-257");
Student student2 = new Student("Lara Mendoza", "22-15678-429");

// Create different types of borrowable resources
Borrowable book = new Book("Introduction to Java");
Borrowable journal = new Journal("AI Research Journal");
Borrowable audioBook = new AudioBook("Learn Java by Listening");
Borrowable eJournal = new EJournal("Digital Journal of AI Innovations");

// Students can borrow any type of resource through the same interface
student1.borrowResource(book);
student2.borrowResource(journal);
student3.borrowResource(audioBook);
student4.borrowResource(eJournal);
```

### Expected Output

When you run the application, you'll see:

```
================= Borrowing Transaction =================
Student Name : Dominic Santos
Student No.  : 22-16901-257
Resource     : Book - (Introduction to Java)
=========================================================

================= Borrowing Transaction =================
Student Name : Lara Mendoza
Student No.  : 22-15678-429
Resource     : Journal - (AI Research Journal)
=========================================================

================= Borrowing Transaction =================
Student Name : Miguel Tan
Student No.  : 22-19988-135
Resource     : Audio Book - (Learn Java by Listening)
=========================================================

================= Borrowing Transaction =================
Student Name : Bianca Reyes
Student No.  : 22-18759-342
Resource     : E-Journal - (Digital Journal of AI Innovations)
=========================================================
```

## üîß Extending the Project

### Adding New Resource Types

To add a new resource type (e.g., `Magazine`):

1. **Create** a new class implementing the `Borrowable` interface
2. **Implement** the required methods (`getResourceType()`, `getTitle()`)
3. **Use** the new resource type with existing Student objects

Example:
```java
public class Magazine implements Borrowable {
    private String title;

    public Magazine(String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }

    @Override
    public String getResourceType() {
        return "Magazine";
    }

    @Override
    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }
}

// Usage
Borrowable magazine = new Magazine("Tech Weekly");
student1.borrowResource(magazine);
```

### Key Benefits of This Design

- **No Code Changes Required**: Adding new resource types doesn't require modifying the `Student` class
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without changes
- **Consistent Interface**: All resource types follow the same contract
- **Easy Testing**: Each component can be tested independently

## üéØ Design Patterns Used

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- **Purpose**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions
- **Benefits**: Reduces coupling, increases flexibility, and makes the system more maintainable
- **Implementation**: `Student` class depends on the `Borrowable` interface, not concrete resource classes

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **Purpose**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use
- **Benefits**: Keeps interfaces focused and cohesive
- **Implementation**: `Borrowable` interface contains only methods that all resource types need

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **Purpose**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
- **Benefits**: Allows adding new functionality without changing existing code
- **Implementation**: New resource types can be added without modifying the `Student` class

## üß™ Testing

The `TestProgram` class serves as both a demonstration and validation of the SOLID principles:

- **DIP Validation**: Shows that `Student` can work with any `Borrowable` implementation
- **OCP Validation**: Demonstrates that new resource types work without code changes
- **LSP Validation**: All resource types can be substituted for the `Borrowable` interface
- **SRP Validation**: Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility
