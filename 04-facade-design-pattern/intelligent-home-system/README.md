# Intelligent Home System

A Java implementation of the **Facade Design Pattern** for efficient home automation and device management. This project demonstrates how to simplify complex subsystem interactions by providing a unified interface for controlling multiple home devices.

## 📋 Overview

The Intelligent Home System allows you to control various home devices (lights, TV, and air conditioning) through a single, simplified interface. Instead of requiring users to interact with each device individually, the system provides a unified facade that abstracts the complexity of the underlying subsystems, making home automation more intuitive and maintainable.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project implements the **Facade Design Pattern** with the following components:

- **HomeService Interface**: Defines the contract for all home device services
- **HomeInterface Facade**: Provides a unified interface to control all home devices
- **Concrete Device Classes**: Light, TV, and AirConditioning implementations
- **Main Application**: Demonstrates the facade pattern in action

### Design Pattern Benefits

- **Simplified Interface**: Clients only need to interact with one facade class
- **Reduced Complexity**: Hides the complexity of multiple subsystem interactions
- **Loose Coupling**: Client code is decoupled from individual device implementations
- **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to device implementations don't affect client code

The following diagram illustrates:
- The architecture of the Intelligent Home System
- Relationships between the core components:
  - The `HomeService` interface
  - Concrete implementations: `Light`, `TV`, `AirConditioning`
  - The `HomeInterface` facade class
  - The main application class
- How the Facade design pattern is applied in this project

## 🚀 Features

- **Unified Control Interface**: Control all home devices through a single facade
- **Bulk Operations**: Turn all devices on/off with single method calls
- **Type-Safe Operations**: Strong typing for each device service
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new home devices
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-structured, maintainable code

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code, etc.)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone or download** the project files
2. **Navigate** to the project directory
3. **Compile** the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac src/*.java
   ```
4. **Run** the application:
   ```bash
   java -cp src HomeApp
   ```

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Usage

The main application (`HomeApp.java`) demonstrates how to use the facade pattern:

```java
// Create the home interface facade
HomeInterface homeInterface = new HomeInterface();

// Create the client application
HomeApp homeApp = new HomeApp(homeInterface);

// Control all devices with simple method calls
homeApp.turnOnAll();   // Turns on lights, TV, and AC
homeApp.turnOffAll();  // Turns off lights, TV, and AC
```

### Expected Output

When you run the application, you'll see:

```
Turning on all services...
The air condition is now turned on!
The light is now turned on!
The TV is now turned on!

Turning off all services...
The air condition is now turned off!
The light is now turned off!
The TV is now turned off!
```

## 🔧 Extending the Project

### Adding New Home Devices

To add a new home device (e.g., `SmartSpeaker`):

1. **Create** a new class implementing the `HomeService` interface
2. **Add** the device to the `HomeInterface` facade
3. **Implement** the required methods (`turnOn()`, `turnOff()`)

Example:
```java
public class SmartSpeaker implements HomeService {
    @Override
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("The smart speaker is now turned on!");
    }
    
    @Override
    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("The smart speaker is now turned off!");
    }
}
```

Then update the `HomeInterface` facade:
```java
public class HomeInterface {
    private AirConditioning ac;
    private Light light;
    private TV tv;
    private SmartSpeaker speaker;  // New device
    
    public HomeInterface() {
        this.ac = new AirConditioning();
        this.light = new Light();
        this.tv = new TV();
        this.speaker = new SmartSpeaker();  // Initialize new device
    }
    
    public void turnOnAll() {
        ac.turnOn();
        light.turnOn();
        tv.turnOn();
        speaker.turnOn();  // Include new device
    }
    
    public void turnOffAll() {
        ac.turnOff();
        light.turnOff();
        tv.turnOff();
        speaker.turnOff();  // Include new device
    }
}
```

## 🎯 Design Patterns Used

### Facade Pattern
- **Purpose**: Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
- **Benefits**: Reduces complexity and dependencies for client code
- **Implementation**: `HomeInterface` acts as the facade, coordinating multiple device services

### Interface Segregation
- **Purpose**: Define a common contract for all home services
- **Benefits**: Ensures consistency across all device implementations
- **Implementation**: `HomeService` interface defines the standard device operations
